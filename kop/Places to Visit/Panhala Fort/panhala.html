		<p style="position:relative; left:20; top:15"><font size=4>Panhala lies on the Sahyadri Mountain Range and is situated in the Kolhapur district of Maharashtra. </br>It is about 22 km to the northwest of Kolhapur on the Kolhapur-Ratnagiri road and is at an altitude </br>of 3177 feet above sea level.</p>
		<h3 style="position:relative; left:20; top:15">Places to Visit in Fort Panhala</h3>
		<p style="position:relative; left:20; top:15">Almost all the holiday packages to Panhala include a tour to Ambarkhana. The </br>Ambarkhana was built by the Marathas and it houses the palace, the </br>administrative division and the granary. The granaries were necessary since </br>grain needed to be stored in case of famines and other calamities. You can also </br>take a look at the Teen Darwaja, which are three gates that provide access to the </br>fort.If you are on a tour to Panhala, you can check out Sajja Kothi, which was </br>built by the Mohammedans in 1008 AD. There is a very interesting story related </br>to this fort. Many say that when Siddi Johar, who was a Bijapur general, attacked </br>the fort, Shivaji escaped from the window while Shiva Kashid, in the disguise of </br>Shivaji fought bravely with Siddi Johar.</p>
