		<p>The Museum is housed on the ground floor of the New Palace- the current residence of Shrimant
		<br>Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj of Kolhapur. The museum has on display memorabilia belonging to the
		<br>Kolhapur rulers which include royal apparel, jewelry, coins, weapons, silver elephant saddles,one of
		<br>Aurangzeb’s swords. A letter from the British Viceroy and Governor General of India are also a part
		<br>of the collectibles to be seen. The magnificent Darbar Hall is in the centre of the Palace and
		<br>the ambience has been recreated to give you a glimpse of Maratha history and its regal splendor.
		<br>The side walls display lobed arches filled with stained glass illustrating scenes from the life of Shivaji;
		<br>carved columns with temple-like brackets support the cast iron balcony above. A raised throne is at
		<br>one end of the Hall. The Photo Gallery has many interesting pictures of royalty including one of the 
		<br>Maharajah with his hundredth dead tiger, elephant hunts and a series detailing how to train a cheetah.
		<br><br>A section of the museum is dedicated to wild life hunting that was then a royal sport. Stuffed Tigers,
		<br>Tiger heads, Wild Dog, Sloth Bear, Wild Buffalo, Lion, Black Panther, Wild Boar, Black Buck,
		<br>a number of other Deer varieties, and a Himalayan Black Bear can be seen here.
		<br><br>There is a small lake in the palace precincts with an open zoo that has several migratory birds like flamingoes. There are also peacocks, emus, spotted deer, geese. The 
		<br>zoo forms a good side attraction to the Museum which is a must for history buffs.</p>
