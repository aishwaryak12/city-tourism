		<font size=4 face="Times New Roman"><p><h3>History:</h3><p>This is a historical building situated in close proximity to the famous Mahalaxmi Temple,within the
<br>walled precincts of Kolhapur City. Although smaller in size than the Mahalaxmi Temple yet the Bhavani
<br>Mandap has great religious significance for the devout as it is the temple of Goddess Tulja Bhavani.
<br><p>Mythology claims that Goddess Tulja Bhavani or Bhavani is a guest of her elder sister Mahalaxmi, in
<br>Kolhapur City At Bhavani Mandap, we can find the life size statue of Kolhapur's most loved prince
<br>Shahu Maharaj. Although, he was deemed king by the city dwellers, most of his political life was spent
<br>under the Raj. On display are stuffed animals actually hunted by Shri Shahu Maharaj including a giant
<br>bison (who has achieved some spiritual importance considering the amount of saffron spread over it),
<br>Panthers, a pair of deer and few others.
<br><p>It also exhibits a modest wooden throne believed to be the one used by Shivaji on his visits to Kolhapur,
<br>strengthening the idea that,he was more a man on a mission with not much regards to wordly comfort.
<br>In its present form it functions as a collective tomb of Kolhapur's Maratha royalty.
<p>This palace has old fashioned architecture and it is huge in size and strong in construction. Shri Chhatrapati got this Bhavani Temple built for members of his family. This temple and its surrounding area is proof of the royal wealth. Shri Chhatrapati used to conduct his Dasera Court in this temple. A beautiful idol of Goddess Bhavani can be seen in Bhavani chowk.
There is also a widespread belief that an underground tunnel leading to Bhavani Mandap from Panhala (the hillside fort about 20 km away from Kolhapur) was built to allow an escape route for warring Maratha soldiers. However the tunnel, if it exists, is yet to be discovered.
