		<p>The Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary, notified by the Government of Maharashtra in 1985, 
		<br>has emerged as one of the most popular places of tourist interest for the fact that it 
		<br>is nestled in a hotspot of biodiversity, the Western Ghats. Also known as the Dajipur 
		<br>Sanctuary, the area in and around this place was earlier the private shooting block of 
		<br>the Maharaja of Kolhapur. 
		<br><br>The sanctuary is home to a variety of wild fauna, including 47 species of mammals, 59
		<br>species of reptiles, 20 species of amphibians, 264 species of birds and 66 species of butterflies.
		<br>The single road traversing from Dajipur to the Savarai Sada takes the visitors across a cross
		<br>-section of the region’s lovely landscapes, enabling the visitor to appreciate the ecological 
		<br>significance of the area and its natural beauty. 
		<br><br>The various trek routes include Raksai Mandir to Rajapur, Farale-Surangi Gate to Dajipur, 
		<br>Thakyacha Wada to Manbet-Borbet, Ugvai Devi to Phonda Ghat Point, Phonda Ghat Point to Shivgad, 
		<br>Zunjuche Pani to Hadakechi Sari, Wagache Pani to Laxmi Point, and Laxmi Point to Jalwache Pani. 
		<br>Trekkers need to take permits and must be accompanied by a local guide, usually a member of the 
		<br>nearby VEDC (Village Eco Development Committee) at a fee prescribed by the park authority.
