		<p>This temple is ensconced on a hill at a height of 3124 feet above sea level, 18 km 
		<br>to the north-west of Kolhapur city. Legend states that three gods took the form 
		<br>of Jyotiba to destroy the evil demon Ratnasur who was terrorizing the region. 
		<br>Jyotiba, the amalgamation of the souls (jyotis) of 3 deities- Brahma, Vishnu and 
		<br>Mahesha is believed to have helped goddess Mahalaxmi to liberate the region 
		<br>from the tyranny of Raktabhoj Rakshasa and Ratnasur the demon. 
		<br>Jyotiba founded his kingdom on this mountain.
		<br><br>The original Kedareshwar temple was built by Navji Saya. In 1730, Ranoji 
		<br>Shinde built the present temple in its place. This shrine is 57 ft x 37 ft x 77 ft high 
		<br>including the spire. The second temple of Kedareshwar is 49 ft x 22 ft x 89 ft 
		<br>high. This shrine was constructed by Daulatrao Shinde in 1808. The third temple 
		<br>of Ramling is 13 ft x 13 ft x 40 ft high including its dome. This temple was 
		<br>constructed in circa 1780 by Malji Nilam Panhalkar. The idol of Jyotiba is four
		<br>-handed. There are a few other minor temples and light towers in the premises as well.
		<br><br>While Sundays are special for visiting this temple, there is also an annual fair that takes place on the full moon night of the Hindu months of Chaitra &Vaishakha. 
		<br>On Chaitra Poornima lakhs of devotees throng the temple carrying tall ‘sasans’ or sticks and chanting Jyotibachya Navane Changbhala . They smear ‘gulal’ (pink coloured 
		<br>sacred powder) on their foreheads and everywhere else turning the whole mountain into a beautiful pink.The government has initiated several improvements for the 
		pilgrims and locals at this holy site and a Plaza Garden Plan is in the pipeline.
